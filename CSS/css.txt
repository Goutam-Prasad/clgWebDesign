CSS is a extention of html document where a particular style is defined to expain the properties of that component
at the runtime 

We can say whenever CSS and scripting languages embeded with the html document it becomes dynamic 
.There are two different way through which we can embed the style into the html document and these are

Through <Link> tag and <style> tag
Link is an open ended tag and always defined in the head section of any html document on the otherhand 
we can embed the style to the exsiting HTML document as a class within the style tag and it is important to 
note that style tag appears at the body part of the html document but
 we can also place  the style tag in the head sectio also
For better understand we may have the following example

*ATRIBUTES THOSE ARE APLLICABLE IN CSS 

color: Color attribute specifies the text color of a particular tag

background-color:  It specifies the background color of the particular tag for which the style is defined

background-image: It specifies  the background image and the syntax will be 
background-image:url(<image path>)


*Text Decortation within CSS

Some of the attributes which appears in the body text can be listed as follows

* text-align: It specifies the alignment of the text with the value left, right, center and justify

* veritcal-align : veritcal align determines the elements vetical position and the values are basline, super, 
                   sub, top, text-top, middle, bottom, text-bottom and also the percentage of the elements height

* text-transform: It applies the transformation to the text and the values are uppercase lowercase capitalized and none

* text-decoration: this attribute adds decoration to the elements text an the values are underline overline line-through blink
                   and none

* text-indent: This attribute indents the first line of the text and it specifies the elements width or length 
                (gap within the starting line and the text)



*CLASS IN CSS (25/05/22)

So far we have seen the casscading style steel can be defined for a particular tag having the syntax as
<style>
    p
    {
        font-size:10px;
    }
</style>

But question arises when we define a particular tag with a style sheet it will affect the entire documnent or page
however if we want to define two diffrent paragraph in a particular html document with diffrent properties or style
then we need classes within the sytle sheet for example if there exist 2 diifrent paragraph named as question and answer
then we may define the classed within the style tag as follows

<style>
    p
    {
        font-size:10px;
    }
    .question
    {
        color:#112233
    }
    .answer
    {
        color:#1f2f3f
    }
</style>

Sometimes we need to define the class without having any specific tag name at that time we will take the help of a special 
tag called the span tag
for example if we need to design the question with a higlighted keyword then we can do so using the span tag such as we 
have done in the html file linked i
