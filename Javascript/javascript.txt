javascript is a scripting language which defines some scripts and acan be easily embeded  with HTML , XML , SGML  etc
here the scripting languages are genrally used for data processing because the scripting languages are genrally equiped with
features like a programming language such as it has control flows(i.e selection iteration and jump) like while loop 
if condition switch statement etc

Javascript in HTML can be embeded with the script tag such as <script language="javascript"> usually these script tag
contains the javascript codes in HTML body and we can define the variables within the head tag.

For example:

<HEAD>

var=a.2.5;
function display()
{
    document.write.println("Hello")
}
</HEAD>
then we call the function in the Script tag wthout writing the function in the script tag

 Usually Javascript runs with the help functions
and the functions will be called or invoked whenever it is required



Form Processiing in javascript

The form Processing in javascript refres t the passing of the feild information form the browser to the
server for furthur processing at their end in order to do so the action attribute and the method attribute 
within the form tag where we must specify the js file through which the onformation will be processed and the method
need to be specifies either get or post here get and post method are two distinct method of form submissions and each
method has its own style of form processing the get method is the default method in a particular HTML form in which
the informations are passed to the server on the url itself

On the other hand the post method uses the action attribute where the specified url will be sent as a http response
withih the body of the html page therefore these thw methods of formp processing acts diffrently
for diffrent situation for example if we need ot send a large amount of data from the browser to the server then we 
shall use the post method similary if we have small amount of data to be sent froom the broser to the server then we 
should use the get method.For easy processing of information from the forms we need ot use form array if the document 
is containing multiple forms in a single document when multple forms exists in a particular document we need 
to process each individual form such as document.form[0] to get acess of the first form document.form[1] to get the 
acess of the second form


we can have a small example to demonstrate ohw the form processing happens in the form array

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>MY page</TITLE>
<script lang="javascript">

 function verfiyZip(length){
  var zipEntry=document.form[0].zip.value;
  var zipNum=parseInt(zipEntry,6);
  if(document.form[0].zip.length==length)
  {
      if(zipEntry!=0 &&isNaN(zipNUM)==false){
          alert(ZipEntry+ "is the value of zipCode")
      }
  }
  else
  {
      alert("Please Re-enter")
  }

 }
</HEAD>
</HTML>



Accessing and writing information to the form

as shown in the previous example we have seen how he form array can be used to acess multiple forms in a particular 
document. However just like the document object contains the forms array the ofrm object also contains the arrays
of elements and can be accessed and manipulated using index
we can have a small exaple to demonstate the same as follows
